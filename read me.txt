example2.py: Generates a series of 11 visual looming stimuli with same the same timing profile as example1.py

The nature of expansion varies between trials and may be one of
- linear expansion, 
- exponential expansion,
- sigmoidal expanion,
- shrinking,
- no expansion,

example1.py Generates a series of 10 identical visual looming stimuli for rodent behavioral studies upon mouseclick.

Each stimulus in the series is 8 seconds long. 
Each stimulus consists of a disk that appears small and is stable for three seconds, undergoes
expansion for 2 seconds, and is stable at its largest for 3 seconds before disappearing.

Dependencies
numpy==1.16.2
pywin32==223
These scripts were tested on a Dell 1908FP monitor.

disk_expansions.py: Functions used in the examples.

graphics.py: portable library with low-level graphics functions used in disk_expansions.py and the examples.

From its documentation: 

" The library is designed to make it very easy for novice programmers to
experiment with computer graphics in an object oriented fashion. It is
written by John Zelle for use with the book "Python Programming: An
Introduction to Computer Science" (Franklin, Beedle & Associates).
